Submission: Submit a one page report (.pdf)

Option chosen : (1 or 2)

Stage 2: Interpreter for Untyped Arithmetic Expressions with extensions 

For this stage, you have to extend the language of Arithmetic Expression to include a new term of your choice. The term should have at least three subterms -  each subterm represented by a metavariable t in the syntax description.  



Submission: Submit a 3 page  report (.pdf) with the following details

Page 1: Design: Write the syntax and the formal operational semantics of the term that you have added

Page 2: Implementation details 

Page 3: Results - Screen shots of sample runs for 3 instances of the added term








Stage 3:  Interpreter for Typed Arithmetic Expressions with extensions 

Submission: Submit a report (.pdf) (maximum 3 pages)   with the following details
